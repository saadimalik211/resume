          <strong>Location:</strong> Remote<br>
          <strong>Role:</strong> Technical Analyst<br>
          <strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
          <p>At CognitOps, I had multiple responsibilities that spanned software development and data analysis. 
            My primary responsibilities included implementing and improving our CI/CD infrastructure to speed up software deployment for new customers and new features, 
            and working with clients to extract and normalize important labor data from their warehouse management systems.

            By adopting industry-standard tools and practices such as Jira and Git, 
            and working closely with our data science team to coordinate and standardize our data model, 
            we were able to significantly reduce our new customer go-live timeframe from 12+ months down to just 45 days. 
            This improvement was the result of a collaborative effort between the software development and data analysis teams, 
            and it enabled us to provide our clients with faster and more efficient service.</p>
