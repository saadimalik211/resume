  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I have a decade of experience as an engineer, primarily working with software
    running on both on-premises and cloud environments, on Linux and Windows.
    Learning how things work is not just a philosophy I apply to my work, but to
    my life. When I break something or fail something, that just means I have
    something to learn and to try again. Repeating this process until success,
    and that feeling of success, is something that I will never get tired of.
