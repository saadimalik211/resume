    <p>
      I have a decade of experience as an engineer, starting with control automation systems in factories and on trucks, and then moving into building, implementing, and maintaining software for both on-premises and cloud environments on Linux and Windows.
    
      Beyond my work, I am always keeping myself busy with various side projects and hobbies. I enjoy tinkering with DIY repairs on my vehicles, as well as configuring and running a home server with about a dozen services - including <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a> for the last 5+ years. I am also passionate about staying active and being outside, whether that means backpacking in the summer or skiing in the winter.
    
      I love trying new recipes and cooking, and I've even set up a fun little app called <a href="https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mealie</a> on my home server to store my favorite recipes.
