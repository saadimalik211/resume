    <p>
      I have a decade of experience as an engineer, primarily working with software running on both on-premises and
      cloud environments, on Linux and Windows. Learning how things work is not just a philosophy I apply to my work, but
      to my life. When I break something or fail something, that just means I have something to learn and to try again.
      Repeating this process until success, and that feeling of success, is something that I will never get tired of.
