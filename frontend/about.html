        <p>
          I have a decade of experience as an engineer, starting with control automation systems in factories and on commercial trucks, then moving into building, implementing, and maintaining software for both on-premises and cloud environments on Linux and Windows. 
          My roles have always involved a heavily technical element, while managing client expectations/requirements across multiple projects.
          Outside of work, I keep myself engaged with several hobbies and personal projects. 
          I enjoy working on DIY repairs on my vehicles and undertaking 3D printing projects with embedded electronics. 
          Also, for several years I've ran a home server with about 1-2 dozen services/projects. This includes <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a> (DHCP+DNS), and <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traefik</a> (a reverse proxy solution).
